# How to contribute
First of all, we would like to thank you for reading this and contributing to YTBSP! 

## Reporting bugs
If you're unable to find an open [issue](https://github.com/Crow08/YTBSP/issues) addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Crow08/YTBSP/issues/new). Be sure to include a title, clear description and as much relevant information as possible.
Also remember to describe the circumstances leading to the problem or simply take a screenshot.

## Propose a feature
Similar to bugs you can open [issues](https://github.com/Crow08/YTBSP/issues) suggesting new features. Already planned features are listed  in the [backlog](https://github.com/Crow08/YTBSP/blob/master/backlog.md) file. We're always open to new ideas and use cases for the script.

## Submitting changes
Please send a [pull request](https://github.com/Crow08/YTBSP/compare) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

## Code conventions
